  <p className="text-xl text-red-300 mt-4">I wanted to tell you how we did it but sadly. The MDX is not working well, and this is all the time we have. But to put it simply. All of this was created with **Next.js** using the `npx create-next-app` command, and then we tried to add MDX, but it wasnt as easy as we expected. But we always have next time. So till then. Thanks for being here though. </p>
